I think that perhaps making MATH 10B a prerequisite (or a co-requisite with 160A) would be a good idea, and would result in students having less trouble with the material. Double integration isn't covered in 10A, so I think a reason why students tend to struggle with 160B in particular is that they aren't comfortable enough with it due to having had to teach themselves how to do it for 160A (although I got an A in 160B, I can still say from experience that - at least for me - this was the case). Though it's literally the first topic of 10B, and the only thing that's needed for the 160 series from that class, I think it's a good idea to demand even that little bit more mathematical maturity.",I agree.,,NA,NA
